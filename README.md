# 🎣 The Fisherman's Logbook
The Fisherman's Logbook is a project where I took my passion for fishing and turned it into a full-stack application. I wanted an easy way to track not just the fish I catch, but all the best moments from my time on the water with friends. Whether it’s reeling in a big one or just hanging out, this app lets me log everything that makes each fishing trip awesome

With this app, I can easily:

- 🎣 Log the species of fish we catch
- 📅 Record the date of each trip
- 📍 Track the locations of our favorite fishing spots
- 🪝 Note the bait that worked (or didn’t)
- 🖼️ Upload pictures of our best catches
